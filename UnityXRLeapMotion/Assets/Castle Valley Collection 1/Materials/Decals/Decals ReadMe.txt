DECALS for the Standard/Default Pipeline are not supported.  The Universal Pipeline does have support for limited decals.

STANDARD PIPELINE:  
Unity does NOT support decals for the standard pipeline, but some asset-store plugins DO support decals for the deferred render mode. You can grab the art for the decals out of the URP.zip if needed, but they arent present in the Standard/Default Pipeline's installation.

UNIVERSAL PIPELINE:
If your project is URP, and you install the URP.zip, you will then have working decal materials.
